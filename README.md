# üöÄ CrisisTriage AI: An AI-Powered Crisis Response Platform

An intelligent, real-time platform designed to revolutionize humanitarian aid by leveraging Large Language Models to instantly analyze, prioritize, and manage emergency reports from multiple channels.

---

## üìú Project Description

In the first critical moments of a disaster, response teams are inundated with a chaotic flood of information‚Äîpanicked calls, fragmented texts, and social media posts. Traditional systems are slow, manual, and unable to provide a clear, real-time operational picture. This delay can be measured in lives lost.

**CrisisTriage AI** is a proof-of-concept platform built to solve this problem. It acts as an intelligent digital first responder, using the power of modern LLMs (like Llama 3 via Groq and Novita.ai) to instantly understand natural language reports from any source. The system automatically extracts critical data, assesses the severity and urgency, assigns a priority score, and plots incidents on a live map, providing emergency dispatchers with the actionable intelligence they need to act decisively and save lives.

This project moves beyond static forms and simple data logging, creating a dynamic, end-to-end ecosystem for modern crisis management.
